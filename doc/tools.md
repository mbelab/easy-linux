## Git

See [git](./git.md) for documentation.

## VS Code

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is an editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers.
The number and quality of extensions makes it a highly-customizable viewer, editor and IDE for all purposes.

## Bash

Bash is an interactive command interpreter and scripting language for (typically) Unix-like systems.
It is commonly used as login shell to numerous Linux distributions and a powerful tool for automation of tasks.

## Python

Python is a high-level programming and scripting language with an extensive standard library and much more (mostly) community-driven libraries.
This makes it a feature-rich programming language usable for applications, web services and scripting.
